# aar-tool

A Leiningen plugin to ease the development of Android .aar projects

## Usage

Put `[aar-tool "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins`
vector of your project.clj.

You will need to add some configuration values to the `project.clj`:

	:aar-name     path to the destination .aar file
    :res          location of the android "res" directory

also you need to specify

    :aot :all

in the options for the AAR generation (not needed for the other
sub-tasks).

### Create AAR library

You can create a aar from the code:

    $ lein aar-tool aar

which will trigger the compilation of the jar, first.

The location of the Android Sdk is extracted from the ANDROID_HOME
environment variable (which must be specified).

The `aapt` to be used is the one in the newest version of the
installed `build-tools` (**Warning** this behavior promotes
non-repeatable behavior between different installations!).

### Create a `R.java` file

Run:

    $ lein aar-tool create-R
    
to create an appropriate `R.java` file in the `src` directory.

### Create the `R.java` file automatically

Watch for changes in the `:res` directory, and update the `R.java`
file as a consequence:

    $ lein aar-tool update-R
